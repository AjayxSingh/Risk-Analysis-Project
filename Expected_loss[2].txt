
 Steps for modeling Expected loss
Expected loss = EAD*PD*LGD

EAD(Exposure at default)
1. Calculate the UGD - Usage Given Default is the percentage of committed yet undrawn balance  that is assumed to be drawn in the case of default 
. We add the Notional of the bonds outstanding  to the Unused commitment*UGD(UGD here would be given by the credit rating the company currently is in.
The Outstanding bond has a notional of 500M + 500M of unused commitment*.65(UGD) = 825M.

2.PD(probability of default) - We are using the merton model. We require the below parameters for calculating PD
* WE take the firm value which is the total assets - 19.57
* Expected return - 6%(historical average return)
* Time - 1 year
* Volatility - 44.7%(Historical asset level)
*Maximum of Short term liabilities - 8.38M
*Maximum of long term liabilities - 20.38M 
Using the values for Short term Liabilities and Long Term Liabilities we can set a default point ie if both the short term and long term liabilities sum to greater than 12.5M
Distance to default formula = (Ln(Firm value 19.57/Default point - 12.5) + Expected return - 6% - (Volatility(44.7%)^2/2)*Time - 1 year)/(Volatility(44.7%)*Time - 1 year)
PD = normal distribution(-Distance to default) = 13.85%

3.LGD(loss given default) - Using Beta distribution(Beta distribution is a continuous distribution with the parameters Alpha and Beta)
For reference I have used the formula given in the Moody's model for predicting loss given default 
Key Variables:

*avg_LGD_on_bonds: The average Loss Given Default on bonds.
*std: The standard deviation of the LGD values.
*max_for_bonds: The maximum allowable value for the LGD in the calculations.
*Function Explanation:

LGD_calculations(avg, std, max_value):
*alpha: A variable calculated based on the average LGD value, maximum value, and standard deviation.
*beta: Derived from alpha, providing further adjustment for the recovery calculation.
mean_recovery: Represents the average recovery rate calculated using alpha and beta.
*LGD: The final Loss Given Default value, representing the proportion of loss.
The result is printed as a percentage, indicating the expected loss rate given a default event.

Important Consideration: The calculation assumes certain relationships between the average, maximum, and standard deviation of LGD values. These assumptions may need to be adjusted based on the specific context or dataset used.


4. EL(Expected Loss) - It is a metric that estimates the average potential loss from a default, calculated by multiplying the exposure at default (EAD), loss given default (LGD), and probability of default (PD) in our case :
EAD = 825M , PD = 13.85%, LGD = 48.75%
EL = (EAD*PD*LGD)/(100*100) = $55710091.760292605
